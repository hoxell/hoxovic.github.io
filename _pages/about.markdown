Welcome to my site!

This is where I post about my adventures in tech. I created it since I was missing a central place to keep my
experiences with tech and my pursue for programming and engineering elegance that makes my life as an engineer easier.

The idea behind the name is that a job in tech is a constant battle trying to bend the technology to your will.
This is one of the best parts of the job and it's mostly the outcomes from some of these encounters that I'm writing about.
