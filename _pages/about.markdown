Welcome to my site!

I'm an engineer, currently working in the automotive industry, who's especially
passionate about software development and developer efficiency.

This is where I post about (some of) my adventures in tech. I created this site
mainly because I was missing a central place to document some good tips and
tricks, either that I want to share (or already have shared) with others, or
simply a place for myself to refer back to to see how I solved some rare issue.
