Welcome to my site!

This is where I post about my adventures in tech. I created it since I was missing a central place to keep my
experiences with tech and my pursuit for programming and engineering elegance.

The name I've chosen for the site is a reference to those situations when just you can't seem to bend the programming language or tech to your will, until you finally find that new angle to the problem or you figure out that last missing piece, allowing you achieve what you had in mind.
