Prepare to have your mind blown! I discovered just yesterday that vim keybindings are available in `zsh` and my life has changed forever! My only regret is that I didn't discover it sooner... Quite embarassing, really...

Seriously, this is a gamechanger, a step closer to development environment Nirvana.

The magic command is
```sh
bindkey -v
```

so stick that in your `.zshrc` and you're good to go.

There you have it, now you won't be able to exit your terminal either :smirk:

What am I gonna do with all the time I'll save?
